This repo contains the code for the Apart reprogramming AI hackathon and uses the Goodfire interpretability API (beta). 

The goal of this project is to identify if we can suppress specific facts in a model by nudging the features related to that fact. We plan to explore if there are differences between specific types of facts or model sizes or nudge amounts.
